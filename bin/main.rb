 Add github action's linting configuration files (.github/workflow/*) to setup github action
 The game should inform the player if the selected move is invalid (without computing what an invalid move is)
 The game should inform the player if the selected move is a winning move (without computing the winning move)
 The game should inform the players if the selected move is a draw move (without computing draw)
 The game should repeat all actions for the next player's move
 A loop is needed in this game (recommended is while but anything else will do) (OdinProject hint)
 A loop needs to be terminated at some point (after a winning move or draw to be more specific). I recommend you use a conditional variable for the while loop.
Example:
game_on = true

# initial instructions for player

while game_on

  # loop for each move

  if winner # and/or draw (the exact condition in this milestone is not important)

    game_on = false

  end

end

[OPTIONAL]

 When you start a new milestone, start on the top of the last milestone branch, e.g., run git checkout -b new_milestone inside the last_milestone branch
